# About this Project
This project is inspired on restcountries.eu by Fayder Florez. Although the original project has now moved to 
a subscription base API, this project is still Open Source and Free to use.

## Important Information
* The structure of V2 has been reverted to its original form from the [Original Project] to maintain compatibility.
* ***Only the latest version will receive updates and improvements.***

# REST Countries
You can access API through https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all


# Contributing
Any help is always welcome! Just edit the relevant file and create a new Merge Request or you can also 
donate using [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/amatos) or [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/amatosg/15).

# Donations
This are getting out of control. As I stated [here](https://gitlab.com/restcountries/restcountries/-/issues/187), the server is not going to hold much longer. I'm getting about 4 million hits **each day** and that means CPU ussage (99%) and also bandwidth consumption (120 GB **per day!**) so costs have obviously increased. **Please**, consider making a donation on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/amatos) or [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/amatosg/15). This will help me pay the server's bills 

# Fields
You can check the [FIELDS.md](FIELDS.md) file to get a description for each field (thanks to @ePascalC!).
